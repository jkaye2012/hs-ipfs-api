* TODO Error handling; looks like there is a special JSON type sent back from failing commands
** Even for endpoints that would normally return a different content type, the error always comes back as JSON.
   We'll need to be able to parse properly depending on the response code.
   Probably the best thing to do would be to model the API so that all operations return either their success type
   or the failure type; in this way, we can also avoid exposing any Wreq-specific types (like the Response
   type that is currently present in the toplevel function signature).
